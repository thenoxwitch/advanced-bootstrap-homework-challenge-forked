    <h1>About me</h1>
    <h3>Front-end developer from Mexico City, Mexico</h3>

    <div class="about-paragraphs">
      <p>
        Hello and welcome to my portfolio! I'm thrilled to have you here. My
        name is Atenas G.I, a passionate Front-end Developer originally from
        Mexico and currently based in the United Kingdom. Since my early years,
        I have been drawn to the world of technology and design. My journey as a
        developer began when I got my hands on my first computer, and I was
        immediately captivated by the endless possibilities of the digital
        realm. As I delved deeper into the world of coding, I realized that
        creating visually appealing and user-friendly websites was my true
        calling.
        <br />My background in Mexico exposed me to a rich and diverse culture,
        and it has had a profound influence on my approach to design. I believe
        in infusing my work with vibrant colors, thoughtful layouts, and
        elements that reflect the uniqueness of different cultures. As a result,
        my designs aim to connect with users on a deeper level, providing them
        with an immersive and enjoyable online experience. Moving to the UK has
        been an enriching experience. It has allowed me to embrace new
        perspectives, collaborate with diverse teams, and learn from talented
        professionals in the tech industry. I've come to appreciate the power of
        unity and diversity, and I apply these principles not only in my
        projects but also in the way I collaborate with others. With a strong
        command of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various front-end frameworks, I am
        dedicated to crafting responsive, accessible, and high-performance
        websites. My curiosity and love for learning drive me to stay updated
        with the latest industry trends and technologies, ensuring that I
        deliver modern and cutting-edge solutions. <br />Beyond coding, I'm an
        avid traveler, a photography enthusiast, and a lover of different
        cuisines. Exploring new places and cultures gives me a fresh perspective
        that inspires my creativity and fuels my passion for innovation. I am
        always eager to take on exciting projects and collaborate with
        like-minded individuals and teams. If you are looking for a dedicated
        and skilled Front-end Developer with a flair for creativity and an eye
        for detail, I would be thrilled to connect and discuss how we can bring
        your ideas to life. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look
        forward to connecting with you soon!
